## ✂️ 1. splice() Method – Practice Questions

1. Remove the 2nd and 3rd elements from an array using `splice()`.
2. Insert a new element in the middle of an array without replacing any element.
3. Given `["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]`, remove only `"c"` and replace it with `"z"`.
4. Remove the last two elements using `splice()`.
5. Add a new element in the middle of the array (based on its length).
6. Write a function that removes `n` elements from any index using dynamic `splice()`.
7. In a string array, insert `"React"` after `"JS"` without manually writing the position.

5. Write a `map()` logic that multiplies each element by its index.
6. Conditional `map()` — if a number is even, return `"even"`, otherwise `"odd"`.
7. Flatten a 2D array using `map()` and `concat()`.
