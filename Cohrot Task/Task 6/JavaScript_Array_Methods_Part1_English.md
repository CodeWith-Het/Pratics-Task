# ðŸ§  JavaScript Array Methods â€“ Practice Questions (Part 1)

## ðŸ”Ÿ 10. push() Method â€“ Practice Questions

- Create an empty array and add 5 numbers using `push()` one by one.  
- Add multiple elements at once in an array (e.g., `push(6,7,8)`).  
- Check the output of `array.length` after using `push()`.  
- Write a function that adds `n` elements to an array based on user input.  
- Merge two arrays using `push()` and the spread operator.  
- Simulate a **stack (LIFO)** using `push()` and `pop()`.  
- Real-world example: Add products to a shopping cart using `push()`.

## ðŸ”Ÿ 11. pop() Method â€“ Practice Questions

- Remove and print the last element of an array using `pop()`.  
- Apply `pop()` three times and print the output after each.    
- Print the array length after each `pop()` operation.  
- Apply `pop()` on an empty array and observe the output (`undefined`).  
- Create a situation where you can compare `pop()` and `shift()` behavior.  
- Write a function that removes the last 2 elements each time using `pop()`.

## ðŸ”Ÿ 12. shift() Method â€“ Practice Questions

- Remove the first element from an array using `shift()`.  
- Simulate a **queue system** where `shift()` removes the front element.  
- Apply `shift()` three times and print the final array.  
- Explain the performance difference between `shift()` (O(n)) and `pop()` (O(1)).  
- Write a function that keeps shifting elements until an odd number appears.  
- Use `shift()` to remove and store the removed element before printing it.

## ðŸ”Ÿ 13. unshift() Method â€“ Practice Questions

- Add an element at the beginning of an array using `unshift()`.  
- Add multiple elements at the beginning in one call (`unshift('x','y','z')`).  
- Simulate a **queue** where new users join from the front using `unshift()`.  
- Use both `push()` and `unshift()` together for mixed insertion.  
- Write a function that always adds a new element to the start and returns the new count.

## ðŸ”Ÿ 14. reverse() Method â€“ Practice Questions

- Reverse the array `[11,12,13,14,15]` using `reverse()`.  
- Reverse a string using `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()`.  
- Reverse an array twice and verify that it becomes original again.  
- Reverse the first row of a 2D array.  
- Write a palindrome check logic using `reverse()`.  
- Understand and explain how `reverse()` mutates the original array (reference behavior).  
- Write a function that swaps the first and last elements of an array.

## ðŸ”Ÿ 15. filter() Method â€“ Practice Questions

- Extract all even numbers from `[12,15,16,17,18]`.  
- Filter an array of objects to get only users with `age > 25`.  
- Get only strings starting with the letter `"A"` from a string array.  
- Return only numbers divisible by 3.  
- Remove falsy values (`null`, `undefined`, `0`, `false`) from an array.  
- Write a filter logic to get only **prime numbers**.  
- Filter products with `price > 1000` from a shopping cart array.  
- Write a logic to filter unique values from an array.

## ðŸ”Ÿ 16. reduce() Method â€“ Practice Questions

- Find the **sum** of `[11,12,13,14,15]` using `reduce()`.  
- Find the **maximum** and **minimum** value in an array using `reduce()`.  
- Convert a string array `["a","b","c"]` into a single string using `reduce()`.  
- Calculate the **total price** of a shopping cart using `reduce()`.  
- Find the **total age** in an array of user objects using `reduce()`.  
- Create a **frequency counter** that counts occurrences of array elements.  
- Flatten nested arrays using `reduce()`.  
- Write an **average calculator** using `reduce()` and array length.  
- Build a **voting system** that counts votes using `reduce()`.
